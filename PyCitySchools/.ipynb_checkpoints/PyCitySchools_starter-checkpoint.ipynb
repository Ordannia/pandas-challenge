    "- The code here is intended to break apart and analyze from different angles both the schools_complete.csv file and the students_complete.csv file.\n",
    "- Pandas is used for the many functions it provides to help sort through the data and help find the real information we need.\n",
    "- Path from pathlib is used to help find the file\n",
    "- First, I use the code to designate what files I am working with, assign variables to them.\n",
    "- Then they are merged and the unified dataframe displayed and given a variable.\n",
    "- The code then pulls specific information from the entire dataset and finds the totals, averages and percentages of the entire school district and displays that information on a new dataframe.\n",
    "- The next code seperates schools by individual schools.\n",
    "- The averages, totals and percentages are found for each school and then displayed in a dataframe.\n",
    "- Next, the code sorts the dataframe in descending order based on % Overall Passing and displays the top 5 highest performing schools.\n",
    "- Then the code sorts the dataframe in ascending order based on % Overall Passing and displays the lowest performing schools.\n",
    "- The dataframe is then broken apart to organize math scores based on grade, the averages per grade per school are then found and displayed in a new dataframe.\n",
    "- Again, the dataframe is broken apart but this time to organize reading scores based on grade, the averages per grade per school are then found and displayed in a new dataframe.\n",
    "- In the next segment of code, 4 new categories that each school can fit into are made, assigned and then displayed in a new column. The 4 new categories are based on Per Student Budget. A new dataframe is displayed with the new column.\n",
    "- The dataframe is broken apart by the new Per Student Budget categories and the average math and reading scores are calculated and the passing percentages are calculated. Then everything is displayed in a new dataframe per student budget.\n",
    "- The next code breaks apart the dataframe by school size. Again, math and reading scores, and passing percentages are calculated and displayed in another dataframe per school size\n",
    "- The final section of code breaks the dataframe apart by school type. Math and reading score, and passing percentages are calculated and displayed in another dataframe per school type.\n",
